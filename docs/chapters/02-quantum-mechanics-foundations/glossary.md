# Chapter 2 Glossary

Terms introduced in [Chapter 2 — Quantum Mechanics Foundations](index.md). See the [full site Glossary](../../glossary.md) for terms across all chapters.

#### Boundary Conditions

Constraints imposed on a wavefunction (or its derivative) at the edges of a spatial region, required for a solution of the Schrödinger equation to be physically acceptable.

**Example:** The particle-in-a-box conditions \(\psi(0)=\psi(L)=0\) force the wavefunction to vanish at the infinitely high walls, and this requirement alone forces the allowed energies to be quantized.

See also: [Eigenvalue](#eigenvalue), [Particle in a Box](#particle-in-a-box).

#### de Broglie Wavelength

The wavelength associated with any particle of momentum \(p\), given by \(\lambda = h/p = h/(mv)\), extending wave behavior from light to all matter.

**Example:** An electron accelerated through 100 V has a de Broglie wavelength of about 0.123 nm, comparable to the spacing between atoms in a crystal.

See also: [Wave-Particle Duality](#wave-particle-duality), [Wavefunction](#wavefunction).

#### Eigenstate

A specific wavefunction that solves the Schrödinger equation for a given potential while satisfying the system's boundary conditions; also called a stationary state.

**Example:** The particle-in-a-box eigenstates are \(\psi_n(x) = \sqrt{2/L}\sin(n\pi x/L)\), each labeled by a quantum number \(n\).

See also: [Eigenvalue](#eigenvalue), [Boundary Conditions](#boundary-conditions).

#### Eigenvalue

One of the discrete, allowed total energies of a bound quantum system, paired with its corresponding eigenstate.

**Example:** The particle-in-a-box eigenvalues are \(E_n = n^2h^2/(8mL^2)\), forming a discrete ladder of allowed energies rather than a continuum.

See also: [Eigenstate](#eigenstate), [Quantum Number](#quantum-number).

#### Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle

A fundamental limit stating that the uncertainties in a particle's position and momentum cannot both be made arbitrarily small at the same time, expressed as \(\Delta x\,\Delta p \geq \hbar/2\).

**Example:** Confining an electron to a region the size of an atom forces a minimum momentum uncertainty corresponding to a velocity of roughly \(6\times10^5\) m/s.

See also: [Wavefunction](#wavefunction).

Contrast with: [de Broglie Wavelength](#de-broglie-wavelength), which assigns a definite wavelength to a particle rather than describing a fundamental limit on simultaneous knowledge.

#### Normalization

The requirement that the total probability of finding a particle somewhere in space equals exactly 1, expressed as \(\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|\psi(x)|^2\,dx = 1\).

**Example:** Normalizing \(\psi(x)=A\sin(\pi x/L)\) on \(0<x<L\) determines the constant \(A=\sqrt{2/L}\).

See also: [Probability Density](#probability-density), [Wavefunction](#wavefunction).

#### Particle in a Box

An idealized quantum system in which a particle is confined between two infinitely high potential walls; the simplest system for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved exactly.

**Example:** An electron confined to a 1 nm box has a ground-state energy of about 0.376 eV.

See also: [Potential Well](#potential-well), [Boundary Conditions](#boundary-conditions), [Eigenvalue](#eigenvalue).

#### Potential Well

A region of space where the potential energy is lower than in the surrounding region, tending to confine a particle; may have infinitely high walls (an idealized box) or finite walls (a realistic well).

**Example:** A finite potential well allows the wavefunction to decay smoothly into the classically forbidden region outside the well, unlike the idealized particle-in-a-box.

See also: [Particle in a Box](#particle-in-a-box), [Quantum Tunneling](#quantum-tunneling).

#### Probability Density

The squared magnitude of the wavefunction, \(|\psi(x)|^2\), giving the probability per unit length of finding a particle near position \(x\).

**Example:** For the ground state of a particle in a box, \(|\psi_1(x)|^2\) is largest at the center of the box and zero at the walls.

See also: [Wavefunction](#wavefunction), [Normalization](#normalization).

#### Quantum Number

An integer label (such as \(n\) in \(\psi_n(x)\) and \(E_n\)) that distinguishes the different allowed eigenstates and eigenvalues of a bound quantum system.

**Example:** The particle-in-a-box quantum number \(n=1,2,3,\ldots\) determines both the number of nodes in \(\psi_n(x)\) and the energy \(E_n\).

See also: [Eigenstate](#eigenstate), [Eigenvalue](#eigenvalue).

#### Quantum Tunneling

The phenomenon in which a particle has a nonzero probability of being found on the far side of a potential barrier even when its energy is less than the barrier height.

**Example:** An electron with energy 0.5 eV incident on a 1 nm barrier of height 1.0 eV has a tunneling transmission probability of roughly 0.07%.

See also: [Potential Well](#potential-well), [Transmission Coefficient](#transmission-coefficient).

#### Schrodinger Equation

The fundamental equation of motion of non-relativistic quantum mechanics; in its time-independent form, \(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi}{dx^2}+V(x)\psi=E\psi\), it determines the allowed wavefunctions and energies of a particle in a given potential.

**Example:** Solving the Schrodinger equation for the infinite square well yields the particle-in-a-box eigenstates and eigenvalues.

See also: [Wavefunction](#wavefunction), [Eigenstate](#eigenstate), [Eigenvalue](#eigenvalue).

#### Transmission Coefficient

The fraction of incident particles (or incident wave intensity) that pass through a potential barrier, approximated for a rectangular barrier by \(T\approx e^{-2\kappa L}\) with \(\kappa = \sqrt{2m(V_0-E)}/\hbar\).

**Example:** Doubling a barrier's width roughly squares its (small) transmission coefficient, an exponential sensitivity exploited by the scanning tunneling microscope.

See also: [Quantum Tunneling](#quantum-tunneling).

#### Wave Packet

A localized wave formed by superposing many individual waves of different wavelengths (or momenta); the spatial width of a wave packet and the spread of momenta needed to build it are linked by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

**Example:** Narrowing a wave packet's spatial width to more precisely localize a particle requires combining a broader range of momenta, increasing \(\Delta p\).

See also: [Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle](#heisenberg-uncertainty-principle), [de Broglie Wavelength](#de-broglie-wavelength).

#### Wave-Particle Duality

The principle that both light and matter exhibit wave-like behavior (interference, diffraction) and particle-like behavior (discrete, localized quanta), depending on the experiment performed.

**Example:** The Davisson-Germer experiment showed electrons producing a diffraction pattern, direct evidence of their wave character.

See also: [de Broglie Wavelength](#de-broglie-wavelength).

#### Wavefunction

The complex-valued function \(\psi(x)\) that describes a particle's quantum state and evolves according to the Schrodinger equation; not itself directly observable, but the source of the observable probability density.

**Example:** A free particle's wavefunction is often written \(\psi(x)=Ae^{ikx}\), with wavevector \(k=2\pi/\lambda\) tied to the particle's de Broglie wavelength.
